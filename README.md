# pressurized_flows
For IBAMR pressure-loaded test cases

This example is based on ex2 from IBAMR/examples/IIM. The three cylinders attached are intended for different grid resolutions.
The coarsest cylinder corresponds to N = 16 grid cells, refined once corresponds to N = 32, and most refined corresponds to N = 64. Before running, set the cylinder you want to use to be named "cylinder.msh" to be selected by the code.
